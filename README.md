# RunescapeNightmareZoneBot

This is an undetectable bot designed for the game Runescape which allows someone to AFK Nightmare zone. This is designed to be done with Absorption potions and full Dharok's.

The bot uses Python with the libraries **pyautogui** and **schedule** in order to simulate random clicks and do them in an orderly but random manner making them undetectable.

### Initialzing the Bot

To initalize the bot one must have the inventory ready with the Dwarven rock cake, Absorption potions, and Overload potions. The quick prayers must also be set to protect from melee. The pictures included in the repository should also be in the same file as the python script, double check this to ensure you don't get any errors. Run the bot and two lists should appear in the command line, these lists are the coordinates of the overload and the absorption potions respectively.

### Using the Bot

Drink the potion and enter the dream, at this point you should be in the Nightmare Zone. Start the Bot and it should automatically use the absorption potions and the overload potion. Everything is AFK from this point on, you can walk away from your computer for 4-6 hours depending on your stats.

### What if I finish the dream and the Bot keeps going?

It won't. It detects when the dream is done and automatically logs you out.
